# Pryngles

## PlanetaRY spaNGLES

`Pryngles` is a `Python` package intended to produce useful
visualizations of the geometric configuration of a ringed exoplanet
(an exoplanet with a ring or exoring for short) and more importantly
to calculate the light curve produced by this kind of planets.  The
model behind the package has been developed in an effort to predict
the signatures that exorings may produce not only in the light curve
of transiting exoplanets (a problem that has been extensively studied)
but also in the light of stars having non-transiting exoplanets (the
bright side of the light curve).

This is an example of what can be done with `Pryngles`:
